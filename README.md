# React Native App

This project was bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/). It's a powerful set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy, and quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Install the project dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Start the Expo dev server with `npm run start`.
